SudzC is a tool for generating proxy code from SOAP-based web service definition files (WSDL). While it supports generating code in multiple languages, it's focus is on Objective-C.

To generate the source code, you can either visit [http://sudzc.com](http://sudzc.com) or download this code. Make sure your code is accesiable by your web server. Open the `Website/php/index.php` page in your browser to locally generate your code.

You might also find the [`flatten-wsdl.py`](https://github.com/amaechler/FlatWSDL) script useful to prepare your WSDL files. Documentation on how to use the generated code further can then be found in the `Documentation/` directory which comes along with the code.
